The naming convention for the dialogue:

the first part is where it is used. 1 = before the first puzzle, 2 = before second puzzle ect.  SL means it is used in a social link
the second part is the name of the character speaking
the third is a number designating in which order they are played.  Subsequent numbers do not mean play them sequentially.
